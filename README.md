# Installing Everything You'll Need

To start off we are going to need a couple desktop applications and various accounts to online sites

## Install VS Code

* Head to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Then download the version for your operating system, 
* follow the onscreen prompt until it finishes,
* search your computer to make sure that the application has successfully been installed \(for windows 10, use cortana. For Mac OSx, use spotlight search or finder\)

## Install Python

For the prework we are going to be using Python 3.7. in order to get Python on your PC, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/), navigate to the downloads tab, and click the button Python3.7.\*. the star means whatever version is there. When you get to the onscreen prompt to install python, you will see on the bottom of the first page 'add python to environment variables', MAKE SURE THIS IS SELECTED. This will save you a lot of confusion later on.

## Install PyCharm

PyCharm is going to be our IDE, integrated development environment, for our python code. In other words PyCharm is specifically made for using Python

To install PyCharm, go to [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). In the middle of the page click 'Download Now'. After that, click community, this is the free version. On the next page you should see the pycharm installer downloading. When it finishes, run it, click through the onscreen installer. When it finishes, it will say 'Run PyCharm Community Edition', click the button and hit finish. If PyCharm opens then it installed correctly

## Installing Git

Git is an amazing tool that almost all developers use, Git allows us to instantly push and pull code to and from the internet using 'repositories'. 

To install Git, go to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and click downloads halfway down the screen. Choose your operating system and wait for the installer to finish. Run the installer and click through the onscreen installer. There will be a lot of pages to click through but you won't damage anything by not reading

## Create a GitHub Account

Create an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Github is an open source online software version control environment. Remember how I said git allows us to push code to the internet? We use github to host the code we push and we can view the code that other developers push here. This will come in handy later so make sure you pick a professional sounding name

## Gmail Setup

If you don't have one already, make sure you have a gmail account with a professional sounding handle. Later on when we start building resumes and portfolios it will be easy to send them along to any potential recruiters. Gmail is easy to setup so steps for installation won't be necessary here.

## Create LinkedIn Account

LinkedIn is the Social Media Platform for businesses and networking. Many recruiters will find you on LinkedIn, or ask for your LinkedIn. Your resume will also be hosted on here too so make sure it stays professional. 

This task is for admissions and career services. They will help guide you with making your profile look the most appealing to potential employers. It does not have to be perfect yet, but take consideration and time building it out.
