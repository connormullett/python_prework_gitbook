# File Structure & Config

Create a new folder where you would like to keep your work for this class. You can always expand and add to this directory so it may be best to keep this organized. Make a folder Called `Python_Projects` \(it doesn't matter where it goes, as long as YOU know where it is\), and inside that folder create another one called `Prework`

##  HTML Prework File Set Up

Inside of our `prework` folder, lets add another folder just to organize it a bit more. Name it `HTMLPrework`

Now we are going to preemptively make our files that we will be using in the HTML Fundamentals section. Inside of the `HTMLPrework` folder, add files to mimic the folder structure below. Make sure you use the extension `.html` to the end of our files or else the computer won't know we are making html files. 

```text
 Python_Projects
     └──prework
         └── HTMLPrework
             00-setup.html
             01-basic-tags.html
             02-h&p-tags.html
             03-lists.html
             04-links.html
             05-images.html
             06-tables.html
             07-divs.html
             08-inputs.html
             09-forms.html
             10-sections.html
             11-articles-headers.html
             12-footers.html
             13-navs.html
             14-iframes.html
```

## CSS Prework File Setup

Now that we have our HTMLPrework file setup, lets go back to the prework folder and add a new directory. We'll call this `CSSPrework` . Just like in the html section, we are going to create our files now. Make sure you give the extension `.css` to files so our computers know that we are making CSS files. Your folder should now look like this

```text
Python_Projects
└── prework
    └── HTMLPrework
    └── CSSPrework
        00-setup.css
        00-setup.html
        01-classes.css
        01-classes.html
        02-ids.css
        02-ids.html
        03-margins-padding.css
        03-margins-padding.html
        04-fonts.css
        04-fonts.html
        05-backgrounds.css
        05-backgrounds.html
        06-widths-heights.css
        06-widths-heights.html
        07-borders.css
        07-borders.html
        08-positions.css
        08-positions.html
```

## VS Code Extension

Visual Studio Code gives us many different third party extensions we can use to optimize and enhance our productivity. One of those extensions allows us to open our html projects in a browser. Let's go ahead and install it

* Open up VS Code
* Go to extensions on the left side bar \(it will be towards the bottom\)
* Search for `open-in-browser` , it will look like this  ![](.gitbook/assets/assets-2f-lau8yfahlshtlbw2dnj-2f-lbv68-k6kcrbpg4gq8g-2f-lbv69k6qf4w90p58ivd-2f1-openinbrowser.PNG) 
* Install it
* Click File &gt; Open  and open the folder HTMLPrework that we made earlier
* Open `00-setup.html` 
* add the following code

```text
<html>
 <h1>Hello World</h1>
</html>
```

* Save your file
* Now press `ctrl+alt+o` 
* At the top, the search bar should have changed to a list of browsers, choose chrome
* A browser window will open and you should see a big `Hello World`
