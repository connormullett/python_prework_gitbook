# Installing Brand New Things in a Brand New Way

## Terminal Talk

Whenever you see the word 'terminal', we are referring to the console that lets you run commands on your system. For windows, you can use either Command Prompt or Powershell. For mac you use, well, Terminal. To open command prompt or powershell in windows, Go to the start menu and search 'command prompt' or 'powershell' then hit enter. For mac press command+f and type 'terminal', then hit enter.

## What's Pip?

Pip is Python's "package manager". Pip stands for "Pip Installs Packages". Pip allows us to install libraries and a lot of cool stuff from our terminals. Lets install a package you will be using for the Python prework later on. 

Open your terminal and type the following line

```text
pip install jupyter
```

It's really that simple, we give the command `pip` so the terminal knows we are going to be using Pip, then tell pip we are going to be installing something, and finally give it the name of the thing to install. Python has an online library called  PyPi, or "Python Package Index". This is where pip looks for the name of the package you gave it. It's also pretty well maintained so don't worry about accidentally installing something that will damage your computer. The packages are coming from a trusted source
